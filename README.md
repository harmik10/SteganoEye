# SteganoEye
Stegno Eye is a secure web-based application that enables users to embed and extract secret text or files within images using advanced steganography techniques. The project integrates OpenCV-based LSB steganography and an improved DCT-based algorithm with coefficient pair encoding for enhanced security and imperceptibility.
